            High school student Clay Jensen receives a mysterious package in the mail with seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, a classmate who recently died by suicide.
            <br/>
            As he listens to the tapes, he learns that there is a page for each person to whom Hannah attributes her reasons for killing herself.

        <ol>
        <li><i><b> "You're not going, neither now nor alive. Why didn't you tell me I was alive?" </b></i></li>
        <li><i> "If you listen to this tape now, you are one of the reasons I am no longer alive" </i></li>
        </ol>
